Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
There are two zip files in this repository that contain code, a drawing of the state machine or task scheduler and a short clip of the outcome of the code. For the final project, this is a thermostat application. The code controls a microconroller that could be used to control a furnace in a home. When the user changes the set point, the LED reacts to whether the circuit for the heater should be on or off based on the sensor reading and how it compares to the set point given by user input. It also sends a signal via wifi to the server. In this case, an app could be used to monitor the temp changes and more.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I utilized the C language particularly well to make a state machine and to use simple code to operate the furnace controller according to the assignment but also based on how an actual device like this might work. I made my code very simple.

Where could you improve?
Copmrehension. It takes a bit of time to understand the code enough to utilize it. Once I get certain things to work, It's typically easier from there, but that initial understanding needs to be better.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Using the product documentation is helpful. I will continue using Google and others when getting stuck, though.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I think figuring out how to operate something with pre written code is often more challenging than doing it yourself, so I think this skill is really going to come in handy.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By making simple code, I made all of the above much simpler. You can easily identify the methods used to turn the heat on, read the temperature and determine when the set point is reached as well as setting the setpoint and how it is supposed to work with the unit.
